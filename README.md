# Gmail Calendar Event Creator (GPT Action)

This repository contains an OpenAPI schema and plugin manifest to enable a **custom GPT Action** that can schedule events in your **Google Calendar** using OAuth2 authentication.

## üöÄ What It Does

This GPT allows you to say things like:

> "Schedule a meeting called 'Team Sync' tomorrow at 10 AM with alice@example.com and bob@example.com."

...and the GPT will use the Google Calendar API to insert the event into your calendar.
